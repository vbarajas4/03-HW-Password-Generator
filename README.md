## User Story
AS AN employee with access to sensitive data
I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria
SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security

## Project Outline

I was given a starter coding this week, in which most of the work needed to be done in the script.js. 

After many hours of working on this application to generate a random password, I was finally able to present a series of prompts for password criteria when they press the generate a password button. The user is able to select which criteria to include in the password and how many characters between 8-128 the user wishes the password to be. The user is also able to choose whether to include uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and/or symbols. The User must select at least one criteria to include when generating a password. Once all the prompts are answered, a password is then generated and the user has their new password written on the page based on the user selections.
